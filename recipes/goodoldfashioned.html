    <h2>This is a great recipe that I found in my Grandma's recipe book. Judging from the weathered look of this recipe card, 
        <br> this was a family favorite. </h2>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul class="points">
            <li>1 ½ cups all-purpose flour </li>
            <li>3 ½ teaspoons baking powder </li>
            <li>¼ teaspoon salt, or more to taste </li>
            <li>1 tablespoon white sugar </li>
            <li>1 ¼ cups milk </li>
            <li>1 egg </li>
            <li>3 tablespoons butter, melted </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Directions</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Step <br> In a large bowl, sift together the flour, baking powder, salt and sugar. Make a well in <br> the center and pour in the milk, egg and melted butter; mix until smooth.</li>
            <br> <br>
