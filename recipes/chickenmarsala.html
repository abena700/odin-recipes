    <img src="ch.jpeg" alt="Chicken marsala">
    <h2>Italian-American dish</h2>
    <p>Chicken marsala is a classic dish that's creamy, quick, and irresistible. <br>
        The creamy sauce made of mushrooms, marsala wine, and heavy cream  <br> is straight up drinkable 
        and we love serving it over a big pile of spaghetti or angel hair. <p>The marsala wine makes it slightly sweet and is what gives it that addictive quality.</p>
    
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <h3>Dredge Mix</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1/3 cup flour</li>
        <li>1 tsp pepper</li>
        <li>1 tsp garlic powder</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Chicken Marsala</h3>
    <ul class="points">
        <li>2 lbs thin-sliced chicken breast</li>
        <li>1 + 1 tbsp olive oil</li>
        <li>1 + 1 tbsp butter</li>
        <li>1 shallot finely diced</li>
        <li>3 cloves garlic minced</li>
        <li>8 oz mushrooms sliced</li>
        <li>1/2 cup marsala wine</li>
        <li>11/2 cup chicken broth</li>
        <li>2 tbsp cornstarch</li>
        <li>1/3 cup cream</li>
        <li>1/4 cup chopped parsley for garnish (optional)</li>
        
    <h4>Steps</h4>   
    </ul>
    <ol>
        <li>In a shallow bowl, mix together Dredge Mix ingredients. Coat each piece of chicken in the dredge <br> mix, shaking off excess.</li>
        <li>Add 1 tbsp olive oil and 1 tbsp butter to the Instant Pot. Using the display panel select <br> the SAUTE function and adjust to HIGH or MORE.</li>
        <li>When butter melts, brown the meat on both sides, 3-4 minutes per side until golden. Meat will not be 
            <br>cooked through. Do not crowd the potâ€“you will have to work in batches. Transfer browned meat to a 
            <br>shallow dish in a single layer and cover loosely with foil.
        </li>
        <li>Add remaining oil, remaining butter, shallot and garlic to the pot and saute until soft, 2-3 minutes. <br> Add mushrooms and cook for 4-5 minutes more.</li>
        <li>Add wine and broth to the pot and deglaze by using a wooden spoon to scrape the brown bits from <br>the bottom of the pot. Carefully add back chicken in a single layer.</li>
        <li>Turn the pot off by selecting CANCEL, then secure the lid, making sure the vent is closed.</li>
        <li>Using the display panel select the MANUAL or PRESSURE COOK function*. Use the +/- keys and <br>program the Instant Pot for 5 minutes.</li>
        <li>When the time is up, let the pressure naturally release for 5 minutes, then quick-release the <br> remaining pressure.</li>
        <li>Carefully remove the chicken from the pot to a shallow dish in a single layer and cover loosely with  <br> foil.</li>
        <li>In a small bowl, mix 1/4 cup cooking liquid with 2 tbsp cornstarch. Stir into the pot, along with the <br> cream.</li>
        <li>Cook and stir until thickened, about 5 minutes, returning to SAUTE mode as needed. Return chicken <br> to the pot and cook an additional 1-2 minutes.</li>
        <li>Serve chicken over rice, mashed potatoes or pasta. Garnish with chopped parsley and fresh ground  <br> pepper.</li>
    </ol>
